1. METHOD FOR MULTI-PLANAR VALIDATION:
   - Generate δR, δB, δG cryptographic planes
   - Compute tensor product δR⊗δB⊗δG
   - Validate via surface integral ∮_Δ
   
2. SYSTEM WITH FRACTAL COMPLEXITY SCALING:
   - Governance layers L=0,1,2...n
   - Complexity C(L) = C₀e^{kL} 
   - Where k = ln(3)/ln(2)
   
3. SELF-MODIFYING ARCHITECTURE:
   - Continuous code rewriting
   - Hard constraint: V_net > 0.8
   - Components follow dS/dt = -kS
