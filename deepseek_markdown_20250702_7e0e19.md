**Problem:** Current AI systems lack secure, ethical self-evolution capabilities  
**Solution:** CosmicMind's 3-pillar architecture:  
- 🛡️ Quantum consensus (∮_Δ (δR⊗δB⊗δG)/ε)  
- 🌐 Fractal governance (C(L)=C₀e^{kL}, k=ln3/ln2)  
- ⚖️ Ethical self-modification (V_net>0.8)  

**Impact for Canada:**  
- 35+ high-tech jobs in 3 years  
- $50M export potential by 2028
